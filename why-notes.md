- rejected by all socio-economic classes (farmers, labourers, office workers) [+student, it, prof, etc. from below]
- restricted offering, contrary to the open internet
- "Even if somebody spends 90 percent of their time on Facebook, that 10 percent is equally as important."
- Pro-internet.org: "It is generally assumed that there is something sinister behind violations of Net neutrality...but that is not always true. ISPs trying to match consumer demand isn't something sinister, it is a market process."
- Facebooks sees its efforts as humanitarian, not commercial
- "Free basics is just a bit suspicious to most people. There's just too much vested interest."

  a favorable impression of facebook, cut out competition

  while the target group was not involved or even informed

- Same concept as Facebook Zero: target disadvantaged non-facebook feature phone users w/o a specific data plan and offer them a text-only facebook
  first internet exp, synonymous to the internet, marketing ploy to get the
  people hooked onto the data plan

  - TRAI Ban under "Prohibitions of Discriminiatory tariffs for Data Services
    Regulation 2016"

## Opinion
  
- Actual impact of freebasics would have been 'negligable' as was running only
  through reliance (4th biggest provider), had a very limited scope (few
  websites, selected through programme) and everything else still had to be paid
  for as well a better speed. With 50% converting to a full mobile contract after
  the first month this scheme was basicially a way to introduce the internet to
  people that don't know it, get them hooked and get them paying. Not a reliable
  way for people to access the internet for free over a long time (service way
  to shit for that) as marketed. (compare 255)
