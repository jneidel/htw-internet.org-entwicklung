- rejected by all socio-economic classes (farmers, labourers, office workers) [+student, it, prof, etc. from below]
- restricted offering, contrary to the open internet
- "Even if somebody spends 90 percent of their time on Facebook, that 10 percent is equally as important."
- Pro-internet.org: "It is generally assumed that there is something sinister behind violations of Net neutrality...but that is not always true. ISPs trying to match consumer demand isn't something sinister, it is a market process."
- Facebooks sees its efforts as humanitarian, not commercial
- "Free basics is just a bit suspicious to most people. There's just too much vested interest."

- speed up the internet access roll-out to new potential customers and give them
  a favorable impression of facebook, cut out competition
- protested by urban middle class internet activists,
  while the target group was not involved or even informed

- Same concept as Facebook Zero: target disadvantaged non-facebook feature phone users w/o a specific data plan and offer them a text-only facebook
  first internet exp, synonymous to the internet, marketing ploy to get the
  people hooked onto the data plan

- "given that a majority of the population are yet to be connected to the
  Internet, allowing service providers to define the nature of access would be
  equivalent to letting TSPs [Telephony Service Provider] shape the users' Internet experience" (TRAI)
- Modi pushes the narative that the rising superpower India is fueled by its
  technological prowess, thus giving more political power to those that create
  technology
- different rhetoric in facebook promoting internet.org (free internet for all)
  and reliance promoting the service (free facebook)
- before facebook was trying to give the rural poor access to information,
  science, social structure, there were the same promises with radio and TV
- widespread belief in technology's ability to lift people out of poverty
  disregarding the historic/political structures that are responsible for that
  inequality
- so the principle to Indias developmental projects are based on the idea that
  you only need to provide the people with technology/information and through
  their innate ability to use it and their better access to markets and
  ressources they will be able to raise their incomes
  - tech fueled development is celebrated by facebook, indian govs, STI

- STI composed of tech startup workers (coders, devs), focused on tech policy
  (law, journalism)
- their way of campagning, technopolitics:
  - spreading awareness through internet platforms (reddit, twitter, youtube,
    own blog)
  - get endorsements from tech companies 
  - go directly against the other sides supporters (flipkart initially supported
    zero-rated plans, but reversed their position after backlash from users)
  - deliberatly choosen name, logo, hashtags, vocabulary to associate the movment with the
    net neutrality movment of the US, and emulating them as well
  - parterned with comedy group AIB (videos) targeted at indias digital natives
- for STI it was also about having a level playing field, the FreeBasics system would make
  access harder for a new app
- STIs members (high-tech workers) only represent 2% of the population (70%
  farmers), but they hold a special place in the image of a "New India"
  (aspirational class)
  - symbol of indias success in the global economy
  - links with the american tech sector (silicon valley) both finacially and
    socially (in 90s 8% of SF startups were led indians)
  - symbol of the middle class climbing into a higher one through middle class
    values (hard work, honesty, austerity)

## Two Bits

- recursive public
  - geeks/technial people sharing a "moral imagination of the technical
    infrastructure" i.e. the internet, coming together to preserver their means
    of association
  - the public is "constituted by a shared concern for maintaining the means of association
    through which they come together as a public" (p 28)
  - "geeks find affinity with on another because they share an abiding moral
    imagination of the techinal infrastructure, the Internet, that has allowed
    them to develop and maintain this affinity in the first place" (p 28)

## Opinion
  
- Actual impact of freebasics would have been 'negligable' as was running only
  through reliance (4th biggest provider), had a very limited scope (few
  websites, selected through programme) and everything else still had to be paid
  for as well a better speed. With 50% converting to a full mobile contract after
  the first month this scheme was basicially a way to introduce the internet to
  people that don't know it, get them hooked and get them paying. Not a reliable
  way for people to access the internet for free over a long time (service way
  to shit for that) as marketed. (compare 255)
