- "given that a majority of the population are yet to be connected to the
  Internet, allowing service providers to define the nature of access would be
  equivalent to letting TSPs [Telephony Service Provider] shape the users' Internet experience" (TRAI)
- 

## Opinion
  
- Actual impact of freebasics would have been 'negligable' as was running only
  through reliance (4th biggest provider), had a very limited scope (few
  websites, selected through programme) and everything else still had to be paid
  for as well a better speed. With 50% converting to a full mobile contract after
  the first month this scheme was basicially a way to introduce the internet to
  people that don't know it, get them hooked and get them paying. Not a reliable
  way for people to access the internet for free over a long time (service way
  to shit for that) as marketed. (compare 255)
